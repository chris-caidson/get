      <h1>Welcome</h1>

        <p>
          In a world where financial stability is not a reality for most… WE BELIEVE that there is a way to create it.
          And, in a world where <strong>Toxic Overload</strong> and <strong>Nutritionally Bankrupt Food</strong> is making us sick … WE BELIEVE there is
          a way to change it. We are a global network of like-minded individuals, who have identified the worldwide
          challenge of living in a toxic society of polluted air, tainted water and a nutritionally-bankrupt food
          supply, wreaking havoc on us mentally and physically. This, coupled with the stress of an uncertain economy
          has given us a common interest in making a SHIFT in the status quo. Turning a Mission Statement … into a
          MOVEMENT.
