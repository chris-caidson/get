            days and only $36.00 more. Seriously, I couldn’t live without them! Would you like to add those?” (Retention

            Where would you like your box shipped? (Repeat the address back)
          </li>

            Okay, so here’s what going to happen next, you’re going to receive an email confirmation from the company that’s going to
            have your receipt and tracking info. You’re also going to get a second email with notification about autoship.
            Make sure to write down the date that’s in the email so no orders ever get sent without you wanting them. Once
            your box arrives and you’ve gone through it, we’ll hop back on a call so I can answer any questions you have,
            and at that time I’ll also show you how to manage your autoship.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’m also going to add you to a private group on Facebook so you can experience the support of our amazing community. How
            does that sound?
          </li>
        </ul>
